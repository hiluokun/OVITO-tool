#This option tells OVITO whether or not to use the minimum image convention when calculating the displacement vectors for systems with periodic boundary conditions. You should deactivate this option if you work with unwrapped particle coordinates. In this case OVITO assumes that particle trajectories are all continuous. On the other hand, if you work with wrapped particle coordinates, this option should be turned on. The minimum image convention ensures that displacements are calculated correctly even when particles cross a periodic boundary of the cell and were mapped back into the cell by the simulation code. On the other hand, if you intend to calculate displacements vectors that span more than half of the simulation box size, then the minimum imagine convention cannot be used. You must use unwrapped coordinates in this case, because large displacements would otherwise be folded back into the periodic cell thanks to the minimum image convention.
#计算准确的MSD需要用到unwrap的坐标即 xu yu zu,而且需要关闭Minimum image convention。至于Affine mapping of the simulation cell（对应fix msd 里的com yes）其实影响没有这么大一般体积不会变化很大其实影响没有这么大一般体积不会变化
